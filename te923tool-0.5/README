You have to install libusb first. Te923 requires libusb.

tar xvzf te923tool*
cd te923tool*
make all

This will build a te923con binary file which is all you need. Feel free to copy it to /usr/bin or make a link.

Usage
The usage of the tool is very simple. There are some command line options you can use.

-D gives you a debug output. Its usefull if you send me an email
for debugging.

-d dumps all data stored in internel memory (only small versio is
supportet right now)

-s gets the status from the device. See status info for more
details

-i sets the output for invalid values (unreachable sensors),
default is hidden

-h prints a help text

-v prints the version number of the te923 tool

If you start the tool (you have to start it as root), you get a colon separated line with all values. Unknown values (if sensor is not present) are hidden.

T0:H0:T1:H1:T2:H2:T3:H3:T4:H4:T5:H5:PRESS:UV:FC:STORM:WD:WS:WG:WC:RC

-  T0    - temperature from internal sensor in 째C
-  H0    - humidity from internal sensor in % rel
-  T1..5 - temperature from external sensor 1..4 in 째C
-  H1..5 - humidity from external sensor 1...4 in % rel
-  PRESS - air pressure in mBar
-  UV    - UV index from UV sensor
-  FC    - station forecast, see below for more details
-  STORM - stormwarning; 0 - no warning, 1 - fix your dog
-  WD    - wind direction in n x 22.5째; 0 -> north
-  WS    - wind speed in m/s
-  WG    - wind gust speed in m/s
-  WC    - windchill temperature in 째C
-  RC    - rain counter (maybe since station starts measurement) as value


weather forecast means (as precisely as possible)
0 - heavy snow
1 - little snow
2 - heavy rain
3 - little rain
4 - cloudy
5 - some clouds
6 - sunny
If you use the option -s you get a status report of the device. The output is

SYSSW:BARSW:EXTSW:RCCSW:WINSW:BATR:BATU:BATW:BAT5:BAT4:BAT5:BAT2:BAT1

SYSSW  - software version of system controller
BARSW  - software version of barometer
EXTSW  - software version of UV and channel controller
RCCSW  - software version of rain controller
WINSW  - software version of wind controller
BATR   - battery of rain sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)
BATU   - battery of UV sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)
BATW   - battery of wind sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)
BAT5   - battery of sensor 5 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
BAT4   - battery of sensor 4 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
