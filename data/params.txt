Output format is colon separatet values. Invalid values or values from not present sensors
are hidden by default. You can set output for invalid with -i option. Output format:

T0:H0:T1:H1:T2:H2:T3:H3:T4:H4:T5:H5:PRESS:UV:FC:STORM:WD:WS:WG:WC:RC

  T0    - temperature from internal sensor in 째C
  H0    - humidity from internal sensor in % rel
  T1..5 - temperature from external sensor 1..4 in 째C
  H1..5 - humidity from external sensor 1...4 in % rel
  PRESS - air pressure in mBar
  UV    - UV index from UV sensor
  FC    - station forecast, see below for more details
  STORM - stormwarning; 0 - no warning, 1 - fix your dog 
  WD    - wind direction in n x 22.5째; 0 -> north
  WS    - wind speed in m/s
  WG    - wind gust speed in m/s
  WC    - windchill temperature in 째C
  RC    - rain counter (maybe since station starts measurement) as value

    weather forecast means (as precisely as possible)
      0 - heavy snow
      1 - little snow
      2 - heavy rain
      3 - little rain
      4 - cloudy
      5 - some clouds
      6 - sunny

Status output means:

SYSSW:BARSW:EXTSW:RCCSW:WINSW:BATR:BATU:BATW:BAT5:BAT4:BAT5:BAT2:BAT1

  SYSSW  - software version of system controller
  BARSW  - software version of barometer
  EXTSW  - software version of UV and channel controller
  RCCSW  - software version of rain controller
  WINSW  - software version of wind controller
  BATR   - battery of rain sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)
  BATU   - battery of UV sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)
  BATW   - battery of wind sensor (1-good (not present), 0-low)
  BAT5   - battery of sensor 5 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
  BAT4   - battery of sensor 4 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
  BAT3   - battery of sensor 3 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
  BAT2   - battery of sensor 2 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
  BAT1   - battery of sensor 1 (1-good (not present), 0-low)
